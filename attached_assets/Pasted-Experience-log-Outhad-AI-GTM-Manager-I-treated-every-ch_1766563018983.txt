Experience log:
Outhad AI - GTM Manager I treated every channel like an experiment. Ran A/B tests, tracked what actually moved the needle, then doubled down. That systematic approach drove a 35% lift in discovery calls and helped us break into two entirely new verticals. I don't just execute campaigns; I find the markets and figure out how to win them.
First National Bank & Trust Company - Product Manager Intern I walked into a complex problem: 30 branches, 130K customers, and no clear path forward. Built the dashboards, interviewed 25 stakeholders, modeled the scenarios, and delivered a roadmap projecting 22% OPEX cuts and 19% ROI lift. Then I spotted the fraud team drowning in manual work, built them an automation, and shipped it. I think strategically, but I also get things done.
BVK Associates - Strategy & Insights Intern I had 2 weeks to turn client ambiguity into complete brand strategies. Through 15+ rapid interviews and competitive research, I synthesized the noise into positioning frameworks that worked across healthcare, travel, and higher-ed. Then I made sure it mattered: built enablement docs, tracked performance, and turned data into narratives that shifted real budget decisions. I move fast through uncertainty and make strategy actionable.
